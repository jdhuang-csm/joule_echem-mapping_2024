# Raw electrochemical data

This folder contains all of the raw electrochemical data used in the paper. Data were collected from two different samples, described below.

## Li-ion battery (LIB)
Data collected from a Molicel INR-18650-M35A cell at room temperature. `basic` contains measurements at 100% state of charge (SOC) for validation of the DRT-DOP inversion and hybrid impedance measurement techniques. `mapping` contains hybrid measurements from charge-discharge cycles at various C rates.

## Protonic ceramic electrochemical cell (PCEC)
Data collected from a laboratory-scale protonic ceramic electrochemical cell (PCEC). `basic` contains measurements at open circuit for validation of the techniques introduced in this work. `mapping` contains hybrid measurements at different cell potentials and atmospheres.
